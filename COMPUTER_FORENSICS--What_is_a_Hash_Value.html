<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>What is a Hash Value</h1><br/>• Hash is unique value generated by cryptographic hashing algorithms<br />• Hash values are used in variety of ways including cryptography and evidence integrity<br />• Referred as Digital Fingerprints or Digital DNA<br />• Any change to hard drive, even single bit will result in different hash value<br />• Any tampering or manipulation of evidence is readily detectable<br />• Most common hash functions: MD5, SHA1, SHA2<br />• Used throughout the Forensic process<br />• Use for verification of cloned evidence and is exact duplicate<br />• Used as integrity check at any point<br />• Examiner may change evidence to opposite side for which the hash value is sent along to be compared to original<br />• Comparison verifies that image is bit for bit copy  <br />• Relevant hash values were generated and recorded throughout the case<br />• Also included with Final report<br />• Digital fingerprints are crucial to demonstrate integrity<br /></div>
